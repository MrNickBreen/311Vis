# 311Vis
Taking 311 Open data and vizualizing it in a leaderboard.

## Live Demo
http://rawgit.com/MrNickBreen/311Vis/master/scrap/index.html


## Run locally
*HTML Leaderboard*
- cd into scraps folder
- python -m SimpleHTTPServer

*Python script to make CSV training data set for BigML*
- cd into analysis folder
- pip install python-dateutil
- pip install pytz
- python main.py
- (notice that train_sample311.csv is created)

## Bonus commands for dev console:
- see all entries, but keep filter of min size: `drawChart(filteredList, filteredList.length)`
- see all entries: `drawChart(comparisonList, comparisonList.length)`
- adjust timespan to 16 days: `start(16);`



## Steps to Redeploy
### Sample redeploy to edmentond.

## Brainstorming Ideas:
- leadboard for the week of closed tickets by department (by percentage or sorted by change from prior week)
  - After looking at the data, suggested we filter to agencies with >40 tickets this week.
- leaderboard of Neighbourhood with most open tickets (by %)
- 'Achievments / badges' for fastest responding department, best close rate, most engaged neighbourhood that reports the most, etc...
- *Use BigML* to predict chance of a ticket being closed, and the biggest factors.
- colour code neighbourhoods with open ticks (coloropleth)
- open tickets preportional to income
- colour code census tracts (same number of people per area)
